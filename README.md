# GPS-Location-Tracker-with-SOS-Capabilities
This paper proposes a design for an IoT based battery powered GPS based tracking system with continuous tracking and an SOS feature. The device when triggered uses a micro-controller and a GPS module to extract location data and send it to a group of registered users and a central server using a GSM module via SMS and AT commands. The central server will store the location periodically in a MongoDB and NodeJS based database. This data will be accessible to the user presented on a map using Open Layers via a HTML pages-based website hosted on AWS using registered credentials. The SMS received by registered guardians will also have the triggered location of the device formatted in a link that opens the location in google maps. During the SOS mode all nearby devices whose location is stored in the database will also be alerted creating a community of secure users.
